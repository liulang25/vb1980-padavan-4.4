.SH "NAME"
scriptlive \- re\-run session typescripts, using timing information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBscriptlive\fP [options] \fItimingfile\fP \fItypescript\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This program re\-runs a typescript, using stdin typescript and timing information to ensure that input happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.
.sp
The \fBsession is executed\fP in a newly created pseudoterminal with the user\(cqs $SHELL (or defaults to \fI/bin/bash\fP).
.sp
\fBBe careful!\fP The typescript may contain arbitrary commands. It is
recommended to use \fB"scriptreplay \-\-stream in \-\-log\-in typescript"\fP
(or with \fB\-\-log\-io\fP instead of \fB\-\-log\-in\fP) to verify the typescript
before it is executed with \fBscriptlive\fP.
.sp
The timing information is what \fBscript\fP(1) outputs to the file specified by
\fB\-\-log\-timing\fP. The typescript has to contain stdin information, and is what
\fBscript\fP(1) outputs to the file specified by \fB\-\-log\-in\fP or \fB\-\-log\-io\fP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-I\fP, \fB\-\-log\-in\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\*(Aqs terminal input.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-B\fP, \fB\-\-log\-io\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\*(Aqs terminal output and input.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-E\fP, \fB\-\-echo\fP \fIwhen\fP
.RS 4
This option controls the \fBECHO\fP flag for the slave end of the session\(cqs
pseudoterminal. The supported modes are \fBalways\fP, \fBnever\fP, and \fBauto\fP.
.sp
The default is \fBauto\fP \(em in which case \fBECHO\fP is enabled. This default
behavior is subject to change.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-timing\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
File containing \fBscript\fP\*(Aqs timing output.
This option replaces the \fItimingfile\fP positional argument.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T\fP, \fB\-\-log\-timing\fP \fIfile\fP
.RS 4
An alias for \fB\-t\fP; maintained for compatibility with the \fBscript\fP(1)
command\-line options.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-divisor\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Speed up the replay displaying this \fInumber\fP of times. The argument is a floating\-point number. It\(cqs called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor. This option overrides old\-style arguments.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-maxdelay\fP \fInumber\fP
.RS 4
Set the maximum delay between updates to \fInumber\fP of seconds. The argument is a floating\-point number. This can be used to avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Display help text and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Display version and exit.
